sharing 
Define the approach you would take to solve the problem and document it 
Get the data and determine what type of machine learning problem it is 
Outline the possible algorithms you would use to create the model(Do your research)
Conduct an exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution of variables, identify correlation and gain insights into the dataset
Handle missing values and encode categorical column  and scale feature if necessary 

HINT: You can encode categorical column using libraries like Label Encoder and OHE(one hot encoder)
Scaling features is ensuring thereâ€™s no disparity in the variation for the features \, so that no feature is given preference. You can use standard scaling or Min-max scaling  for that.(Feel free to read more on this
Evaluate different regression algorithms and select the one with the best performance (e.g Linear Regression, Decision tree regressor, Random forest regressor etc.)
